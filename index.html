      <h2>Traveling to the other universe</h2>
      <div class="w3-justify" style="height:600px">
        <p >There might be a chance to travel to another unknown universe! The white hole looks like a black hole but instead of trash-packing singularity, it opens back up into a distant region of spacetime which is unknown. Wormhole: the connection between two points in spacetime. Those are now just theories, no real observation of white holes and wormholes. But it can exit and tunnel time and space. For a wormhole, the neck is too narrow to pass for human beings and close too quickly(unstable), may need some material with a negative energy density to keep the neck open. (exotic forms of materials) </p>

        <p>Quantum mechanics: to better understand the black hole, we need some quantum physics. We start with hawking radiation: in quantum physics, electron or positron fall inside the horizon, the other will remain outside with no companion to annihilate it, this escaping particle is hawking radiation. (see figure). Hawking radiation now is still not be observed, due to the very long wavelength and very low temperature and energy associated with a black hole, To detect it, the mass of the black hole is the same or smaller than the mass of the moon would be easier to detect.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thermodynamics: a study of temperature and entropy. Entropy: all maters have this property and are usually explained as a measurement of the disorder within a system. Zeroth law: the temperature of two things are the same when they're in thermal equilibrium. First law: energy is conserved in an isolated system. Second law: heat flows from hotter objects to colder objects. Third law: as we cool things down to absolute 0, all processes stop. Thermodynamics of black hole: zeroth law: black hole's surface gravity is the same across the surface. First law: changes to the black hole depend on the mass and energy consumed. Second law: the area of a black hole always increases as matter falls in, the sum of the area of the black hole and entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation always increases.

            To better understand things that happen inside of a black hole, we may need something called the quantum theory of gravity. But now, this kind of theory is still undiscovered. Why do we need such a theory? Will for classical physics, we meet strong gravitational field, the theory will be invalid. For Einstein's equation of gravity, it works well for most of the journey into the black hole, but it has shortcomings: it requires we know the particles' location and speeds exactly. But, based on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that there is a limit on how precisely we can determine the location and speed.

        <h2 style="font-size:2.4vw; ">What happens if you fall into the BH?</h2>
        <p style="font-size:1.4vw; margin-right:3vw "> As you get closer and closer to the black hole event horizon, the observer from far away sees your movements slowing down due to the time dilation, which takes place around the strong gravitation pull. At the moment you fall into the black hole, the observer sees you are still forever though you already fall into the black hole. You yourself will see everything normal until you fall inside, you will see the history of the universe quickly passing through your view...</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:2.4vw; margin-right:4vw">Will all the information entered into the BH be destroyed?</h2>
        <p style="font-size:1.4vw; margin-right:4vw; ">we can introduce the black hole information paradox: in quantum physics: reversibility tells us we can go backward from one state just as well as go forwards. Quantum determinism tells that we can predict with certainty what the probabilities of outcomes will be. Those tell us information can always be preserved. But in classical physics: there's no way to transmit data across the event horizon. There is a hypothesis that there is a wall called an MPS firewall that is inside of the black hole that destroys information from the outside and observers on the outside maybe can see the destruction of information. </p>
